Acknowledgements:
The implementation of an immutable hash-trie in the
com.jayway.collections.internal.hashtrie package is based on Daniel Spiewak's
'HashTrie' implementation for Scala that is in turn a clean-room port of Rich
Hickey's persistent hash trie implementation from Clojure (http://clojure.org).
Originally presented as a mutable structure in a paper by Phil Bagwell. The
implementation is also heavily inspired by Eugene Vigdorchik's blog post:
http://groovy.dzone.com/articles/immutable-data-structures

All the data-structures are also inspire by the data-structures in Clojure.
